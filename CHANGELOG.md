# Changelog

## What's Changed
## [4.12.6-car] Car Head Unit support (non-Android Auto)
* feat: add Car UI mode with larger fonts, icons, and touch targets for car head-unit displays
* feat: add hardware media key (steering wheel button) support — handles KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE, KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY, KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE, KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT, KEYCODE_MEDIA_PREVIOUS, KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK, DPAD_CENTER/ENTER
* feat: add Car UI mode toggle in Settings → Car Head Unit
* Car UI mode OFF: appearance and behaviour remain at prior defaults

**Car UI mode — what changes:**
- Text sizes increased across primary surfaces for easier readability on car screens
- Minimum touch target height raised for safer in-car interaction
- Steering wheel/hardware media keys reliably control playback via the active MediaSession

**Supported hardware keys:**
- KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY — resume playback
- KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE — pause playback
- KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE — toggle play/pause
- KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK — toggle play/pause
- KEYCODE_MEDIA_NEXT — skip to next track
- KEYCODE_MEDIA_PREVIOUS — skip to previous track
- KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER / KEYCODE_ENTER — toggle play/pause (rotary knob press)

**Known limitations:**
- Car UI mode must be enabled manually in Settings; automatic detection is not implemented.
- Visual scale overrides are applied at theme level; individual layouts use the system text-scale, so very large system font-scale settings may cause overflow on small screens.

## [4.0.6](https://github.com/eddyizm/tempo/releases/tag/v4.0.6) (2025-10-26)
## Attention
This release will not update previous installs as it is considered a new app, no longer `Tempo`, new icon, new app id, and new app name. Hoping it will not be a huge inconvenience but was necessary in order to publish to app stores like IzzyDroid and FDroid.  

**Android Auto** 
Support should be the same as before, however, I was not able to test any of the icons/visuals, so please let me know if there are any remnants of the tempo logo/icon as I believe I removed them all and replaced them successfully.
